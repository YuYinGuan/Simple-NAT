My code is split into three part, 3NAT.c, 3EXsend.c, and 3EXrecv.c.
3NAT is the nat, 3EXsend is the client and 3EXrecv is the server.
The way my code is constructed is that:

	client creates socket on with port 10000 with nat at 10.0.0.2
		client - socket created, connect to nat with given addr
		nat - socketet created with given addr, listen, accept

	nat creates socket on port 10002 with server at 192.168.0.2
		nat - socket created, connect to nat with given addr
		server - socketet created with given addr, listen, accept

	server creates socket on port 10001 with server at 192.168.0.1
		server - socket created, connect to nat with given addr
		nat - socketet created with given addr, listen, accept

The client/3EXsend is created with a tokenizer that reads in the file
and catagorize them into 3 arrays. Then I compared the time differences
between data and deleted the invalded data that is less than 1 second apart.
The vmn and port number is compared with other data in the array to get 
ride of vmn with another port number and visa versa. The one int data is 
sent to the nat with the send function. Nat uses receive and then uses the send
to send the server of what it just received. Server gets the data with
the receive function and prints it out into a file and sents a string/acknowledgement.
Nat takes the ACK with receive function and sends ACK to client upon receiving data.
The client will sleep for time periods next data time subtract previous data time.
When creating an array of data, I put -1 on the end of the array. When the 
-1 is sent, the NAT and Server that recieved it is program to end the while loop and 
close sockets, thus closing the program.
